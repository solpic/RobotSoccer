# RobotSoccer
This drives a Lego Mindstorms robot to play mini golf using OpenCV. 

*state_rep_golf.py* actually runs the AI program

First the vision must be calibrated to actually see the robot, ball, hole, and boundaries. Unfortunately, many files are duplicates and the code is overall disorganized, but *golf_ai.py* contains the actual AI code. Due to lack of commenting it would be difficult to actually browse through the rest, but it can be quickly looked through to see the overall organization of the AI/vision servers and how the system is constructed.
